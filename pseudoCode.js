//In my HTML I'll need div that will hold the time table
//A div or header that shows the current day
//js has a DateObject() built in
//Input fields inside the div for the eight hours in the day

//When the page loads, check local storage,
//if appointments exists, load it into the corresponding time slot

//I'll need a function to capture the user input and saving it in local storage
//each input field will need it's own save button
